# Image_Segmentation_UNet_and_SegNet

This repository contains an implementation of image segmentation using two popular deep learning architectures: UNet and SegNet. Both models are applied to image segmentation tasks, demonstrating their ability to classify each pixel in an image into different categories. This project showcases the effectiveness of these models in segmenting objects from images with high accuracy.

Overview

Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision where the goal is to partition an image into multiple segments or regions of interest. This repository focuses on two state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, UNet and SegNet, to perform semantic segmentation.

	•	UNet: A widely-used architecture for biomedical image segmentation, known for its U-shaped structure that captures context with the encoder while preserving details using the decoder.
	•	SegNet: A deep encoder-decoder architecture designed for segmentation tasks, notable for its efficient use of max-pooling indices to reconstruct the image during the decoding process.

Objectives

	•	Understand Image Segmentation: Learn how to apply deep learning models to perform pixel-level classification.
	•	Implement and Train UNet: Train a UNet model from scratch or with pre-trained weights on your dataset for image segmentation.
	•	Implement and Train SegNet: Apply the SegNet architecture for pixel-wise classification, and observe how it compares to UNet.
	•	Visualize Segmentation Results: Generate segmentation masks and visualize how well the models perform on test images.

Models

1. UNet

UNet is an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, designed for segmentation tasks that require high accuracy, especially for medical images. It consists of a contracting path to capture features and an expansive path for precise localization.

Key features:

	•	Encoder for down-sampling with max-pooling.
	•	Decoder for up-sampling and reconstructing spatial dimensions.
	•	Skip connections to preserve details from earlier layers.

2. SegNet

SegNet is an encoder-decoder architecture optimized for segmentation tasks with limited computational resources. It uses max-pooling indices from the encoder to guide the up-sampling in the decoder, which allows for better spatial reconstruction with fewer parameters.

Key features:

	•	Encoder network uses convolutional layers with max-pooling.
	•	Decoder mirrors the encoder and uses max-pooling indices for efficient up-sampling.
	•	SegNet is particularly suited for tasks where memory efficiency is important.
